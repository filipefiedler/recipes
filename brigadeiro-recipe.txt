Ingredients:
 - 1 (397g) tin sweetened condensed milk
 - 1 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
 - 4 tablespoons cocoa powder
 - chocolate sprinkles for rolling

Directions:
 1. In a heavy saucepan, add condensed milk, butter and cocoa powder and cook
 	over medium heat. (Reduce the heat if you use a thin-bottomed saucepan.)
 
 2. Stir constantly until you reach the right consistency - one minute after
 	it starts to pull away from the sides of the pan and the bottom.
 
 3. Pour the mixture into a greased plate, let cool and, with buttered hands,
 	shape into small balls and roll in chocolate sprinkles.
